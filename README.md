# robot

![Create Release](https://github.com/siredmar/robot/workflows/Create%20Release/badge.svg?branch=master)

[robot](http://robotframework.org/) in an [unofficial Python 3](https://hub.docker.com/_/python?tab=description) alpine based docker container.

### Why? 

1. To run tests in an environment that is well isolated from the host
2. To get started fast when prototyping/developing own Robot Framework libraries
3. To be able to take Robot Framework into use where `sudo` is not available
